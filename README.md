# Train-Crossing-with-IR-sensor-and-Arduino-using-Firebase-and-Android-Application

In this project, we are using two IR sensors to detect the position of the train. When the train crosses the first IR sensor, the controller circuit will close the gate and when the train crosses the second IR sensor controller circuit opens the gate.

Hardware
1. Arduino
2. Ethernet Shield
3. Two IR sensors
4. Motor 
5. model train
6. Motor Driver
